This framework provides few algorithms , used to identify differences between shapes in 2D world.
Current implementation includes:

  * **Liniar Algebra supporting project.**
> > Implement also:
    1. Basic, between matrix operations.
    1. Eigen-values and eigen-vectors calculations.
    1. Inverse matrix calculations.

  * **Shape Context - custom modified algorithm.**
> > Implement also:
    1. Hungarian Method for perfect pairing.
    1. TPS - Thin Plate Splines Algorithm.

  * **Hausdorff Distance**

  * **PCA - Principal Components Analysis.**
